# 🎨 Rejoiuce Studio – Website Clone

A high-fidelity, custom-built clone of the award-winning **Rejoiuce Studio** website — known for its immersive visuals, cinematic feel, and smooth user interactions. This project is my personal frontend deep dive into animation, scroll behavior, and creative audio feedback on interaction.

## 🚀 What This Project Showcases

This isn't just a visual replica — it's a motion experiment. I recreated the subtle yet powerful transitions, buttery-smooth scroll, and immersive interactivity that define the original site.

### ✨ Key Highlights

- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):**  
  Handles all page transitions, text reveals, hero animations, and scroll-based effects with precise timing and fluidity.

- **Lenis.js:**  
  Replaces the browser's default scrolling with a smoother, more controlled scroll behavior — essential to mimic the polished feel of studio-grade sites.

- **Howler.js:**  
  Adds satisfying click sounds to navbar interactions. Subtle audio feedback goes a long way in making the site feel alive and responsive.

- **Custom Loader:**  
  A minimal, elegant page loader sets the tone from the start — it’s quick, subtle, and reinforces the sleek design style.
